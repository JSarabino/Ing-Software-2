Every class in Java should have a single job to do. To be precise, there should only 
be one reason to change a class. Hereâ€™s an example of a Java class that does not follow 
the single responsibility principle (SRP):

Bad example

    public class Vehicle {
        public void printDetails() {}
        public double calculateValue() {}
        public void addVehicleToDB() {}
    }

The Vehicle class has three separate responsibilities: reporting, calculation, and database.
By applying SRP, we can separate the above class into three classes with separate responsibilities.

Good example

    public class VehicleDetails{
        //TODO
    }

    public class VehicleValues {
        //TODO
    }

    public class VehicleDB{
        //TODO
    }
